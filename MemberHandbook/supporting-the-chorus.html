                            While it is vitally important that the NCC uses all common marketing methods for promoting itself (such as Facebook and other
                            online marketing tools), it is also imperative that we uphold strict safety standards to protect
                            our young musicians&rsquo; identities, as well as discourage personal memberships to online social
                            communities until they are of appropriate age, or have proper parental consent with applicable
                            supervision. For these reasons, the NCC mandates the following policies in regards to Facebook
                            and other online media:
