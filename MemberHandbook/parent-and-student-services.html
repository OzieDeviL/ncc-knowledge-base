                    From time to time, NCC directors will provide students with soundtracks, both for the purpose of vocal practice at home,
                    and for special projects. In order to accomplish this, the NCC uses an online digital service called
                    Hightail. Hightail allows large files to be uploaded to a server, where it is easy for you to download
                    to your home computers. If the files were small, we would simply send you an e-mail; but as you know,
                    large files may take up too much space in your inbox, or simply be rejected by your e-mail clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is how to easily utilize Hightail to download your NCC Digital Soundtracks&mdash;

                    While the NCC promises a first-rate vocal education through the basic level without the need for private instruction, it
                    also fully supports the individual study of voice for advanced students needing the specialized attention,
                    and also beginner students who wish to overcome possible vocal issues and accelerate advancement. For
                    those wishing to be put into contact with NCC-Approved professional voice instructors, please contact
                    the Executive Administrator with your inquiry. We will be sure to refer you to the best instructor possible.

                    <p class="ncc-topic-response">
                        No. NCC solo roles are assigned based on the quality displayed at the audition itself. It is fully possible that a student
                        who does not take private lessons may outperform a student who does. Will private study increase
                        one&rsquo;s chances of auditioning well? Of course. But it is not a requirement, nor does it give
                        any student a political edge or special advantage within the audition process. Ultimately, what a
                        student brings to any given audition is what he or she is judged upon, and nothing more.

                    <p class="ncc-topic-response">
                        Both Dr. Pamela Blackstone and Maestro Luke McEndarfer offer private vocal coaching outside of the NCC, and have coached
                        many students successfully to elite levels of vocal accomplishment. Beyond their instruction, the
                        NCC works with several other voice teachers that supplement the work they do. One way or another,
                        the NCC will pair you with an excellent teacher that has been verified to teach proper bel canto
                        style singing, which we deem to be the healthiest utilization of the voice for young artists.

                    <p class="ncc-topic-response">
                        Absolutely. Proper teaching is crucial. The utilization of unhealthy vocal techniques is disastrous for the young voice,
                        and can significantly damage the instrument at an early age. Very special care must be taken in the
                        selection of a voice teacher, which is why the NCC will gladly help you, under the guidance of our
                        NCC Director of Vocal Studies and UCLA Music Department Chair, Michael Dean.

                    One of the most important and powerful elements of psychological training at the NCC is for all our students to learn how
                    to brush off perceived failures and disappointments, placing them in proper perspective, learning from
                    them and fully accepting any outcome for what it is. We know very well that a student&rsquo;s chances
