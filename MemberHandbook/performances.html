                            At the NCC, we are heavily invested in providing the highest quality musical experience for both our performers and audience
                            members alike. Therefore, any activities by concert patrons that could potentially take away
                            from the beauty of the music are strictly forbidden. The clicking and flashing of cameras, the
                            holding up of camcorders, and the overall distracting energy of a person who is taking a picture/video
                            rather than listening to the music are all things we strongly want to avoid. Be in the present
                            moment! The gift of live music is that it cannot be experienced at any other time the same way.
                            Don&rsquo;t spoil it by doing anything else other than enjoying the gorgeous artistry your children
                            have worked so hard to create.

                            We recommend that concert patrons sit as quietly as possible during the performance. Try to refrain from:

                            <li>
                                Talking or whispering.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Moving around.

                            <li>
                                Noisily unwrapping cough drops or candy.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Texting.

                            Again, take advantage of the rare opportunity to be completely 100% focused on your children&rsquo;s beautiful singing. It
                            is a precious moment in time that will not last, so let go of the distractions and engage it
