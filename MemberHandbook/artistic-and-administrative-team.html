                    <strong>Dr. Pamela Blackstone</strong>&rsquo;s life philosophy is &ldquo;let what you love be what you do.&rdquo;
                    Because of this, her teaching encompasses a passion not only for music itself, but for the process of
                    bringing it to life.</p>
                <p>Dr. Blackstone began her musical training as a pianist, violinist, singer and dancer in her hometown of Chicago,
                    Illinois. Her studies at the college level earned her a Bachelor of Music degree from the University
                    of Kansas in piano performance where she graduated valedictorian from the School of Fine Arts. Her primary
                    teachers included Dr. Jack Winerock and Claude Frank. While at KU, Dr. Blackstone attended the Aspen
                    Summer Music Festival and School studying piano and chamber music with Rita Sloan.</p>
                <p>Expanding her musical education to include her love of choral music, Dr. Blackstone received her Mas- ter
                    of Music degree in choral conducting from the University of Missouri, Kansas City Conservatory of Music,
                    studying under the tutelage of Dr. Eph Ehly. She also became the Director of Choral Activities at Westark
                    College in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and quickly established herself as a highly sought-after choral clinician,
                    judge and show choir choreographer throughout the Midwest.</p>
                <p>Dr. Blackstone completed her formal study with a Doctorate of Music degree in choral conducting from the
                    University of California Los Angeles studying under Donald Neuen. roughout her conducting education,
                    she earned a multitude of competition awards and scholarships from organizations such as the American
                    Choral Directors Association and Choral Conductor&rsquo;s Guild. Dr. Blackstone was also the Assistant
                    Conductor of the Angeles Chorale and has taught choral and vocal music at UCLA, Santa Ana College and
                    church organizations across Southern California.</p>
                <p>Dr. Blackstone is a professional healing arts expert in the mediums of yoga, energy work, tness and health.
                    Having trained in musical, physical and energetic disciplines, Dr. Blackstone incorporates an eclectic
                    variety of teaching methodologies which inspire her students mentally, emotionally and kines- thetically.
                    Far beyond that, Dr. Blackstone brings her singers an expansive and inspiring energy which throughout
                    her life, has been called &ldquo;positively contagious.&rdquo; In the NCC, she has pioneered a fusion
                    of her healing arts and musical expertise, creating a class entitled &ldquo;You are the Instrument: Yoga
                    for Singers.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Dr. Blackstone joined the NCC Artistic Team in January 2009 and is honored to be part of a world-class organization.
                    For almost twenty years, Dr. Blackstone has been dedicated to teaching choral music across the country
                    to children and adults alike. She has concluded from her extensive experience that whether a musician
                    is ve or ninety- ve years old, beautiful music is a tangible expression of one&rsquo;s soul which must
                    be honorably executed with the nest technique, purity of mind and passion of heart.</p>
