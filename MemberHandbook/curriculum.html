                        <p>At the NCC, students are not just taught music by ear&mdash;they are trained in the study of sight-singing,
                            which requires a vocalist to look at a piece of music for the first time, and be able to sing
                            it proficiently&mdash;both in pitch and rhythm. Sound easy? It’s not! Unlike playing a piano,
                            where one may read notes on the page and play the corresponding keys, sight-singing demands that
                            a person finds the pitches as a result of knowing where they are in the mind, and then replicating
                            them in the voice. Being able to perform this skill with ease and confidence is a sign of superior
                            professionalism that is a prerequisite for the highest levels of music making.</p>

                    <h4 class="ncc-subsection-title">How Kodály Works</h4>
                    <div class="ncc-subsection-content">
                        <p>
                            The Kodály Method, invented and developed by Hungarian composer Zoltán Kodály, is highly structured and sequenced, with well-defined
                            skill and concept hierarchies in every element of music. These sequences are closely related
                            to child development—the way in which young children progress naturally in music. As a child
                            develops physically, socially, emotionally, aesthetically, and intellectually, he or she is also
                            led to develop musically in the acquisition of increasingly complex skills and more involved
                            concepts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the tools used at the NCC from the Kodály Method to achieve musical literacy and sight singing are solfége (do, re,
                            mi, fa, so, la, ti, do), Curwin hand signs, rhythmic syllables, and a movable &ldquo;do&rdquo;
                            system. It is the relationship between the syllables that trains the ear so that in-tune singing,
                            along with accurate sight singing, occurs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By using those tools infused with traditional music reading, students of the NCC begin with the simple, and sequentially
                            move to the more complex, always building on the foundations laid in the beginning.</p>
                        <p>
                            Like all skills, practice makes perfect. Once a concept or skill is learned, it is practiced again and again so that it becomes
                            second-nature. With each layer of mastered skills and concepts, the development and artistry
                            of the student is heightened and Zoltán Kodály’s philosophy is seen in action.</p>
                        <p>

                            priority to students who have had fewer private sessions than others. Unless special arrangements

                            The Art of Singing
                        </h5>
                        <p> Why singing? Why not just a violin or a flute? What makes the voice unique and special, above all
                            other musical instruments? These questions and more will be pondered, while the concept of great
                            singing and what it takes to be an exceptional performer are discussed in this exciting session!
                            Additionally, examples of stellar performances and the world&rsquo;s top singing artists will
                            be shared, as students formulate their own standards for excellence and vocal success.</p>

                        <p>
                            Students will become more in touch with their body&rsquo;s full potential for making music by incorporating techniques which
                            relax the muscles and allow the most beautiful and free vocal sounds to be made.

                        <p>
                            Students will learn about the different sections of an orchestra, and the various instruments which comprise each section.
                            In addition to being able to identify each by sight, students will be trained to recognize the
                            exact timbre of each, so that any can be identified solely by ear.
                        </p>

                            Talent alone will not get you far—the manner in which you present yourself always goes a long way in helping you achieve
                            your goals! In this class, students will learn what is considered appropriate attire and grooming
                            for various concert and audition scenarios. Wrinkled T-shirt and jeans for your opera audition?
                            Drenched in cologne before your soundtrack studio session? No way! NCC singers will always know
                            better.

                            Students will review and discover new concepts relating to professional demeanor and decorum, both on and off the stage.
                            Members of the class will learn how to respect staff in a professional concert house environment,
                            and lend the best possible impression of themselves.

                            What makes the difference between a performance that is solely well-executed, and one that brings it to the level of magic,
                            where audience members are touched and moved beyond words or reason? Is it about singing the
                            right pitch? Or singing with great rhythm? While both of these things are absolutely the first
                            steps towards the goal of being extraordinary, a riveting performance always has that element
                            of something more—something from the heart that is difficult to describe. In this special class,
                            singers will be invited to choose their own music, and perform it in front of their peers, while
                            instructors give their critique, and teach the students to dig deeper into their own emotions.
                            Through this exercise of trial and error, NCC members will discover that only through a true
                            connection to the soul does a piece of music effectively come to life!
                        </p>

                            The Big Audition
                        </h5>
                        <p> What makes one audition stronger than another? How do you walk into a major audition with hundreds
                            of applicants and stand out? What exactly does it take to bring forth your best when the pressure
                            is on, and sing a winning rendition of your piece? Concepts of what defines a strong audition,
                            and what does not, will be elucidated in detail within this highly useful session designed to
                            strengthen the confidence and audition skills of our NCC members. From showing up on time, to
                            being courteous, to the way you walk into the room, to the way you answer questions when asked,
                            to the knowledge you should have about your piece, to the level of execution that it will take
                            to be considered for various types of roles&mdash;here, NCC students will learn and excel in all areas
                            of the process!
