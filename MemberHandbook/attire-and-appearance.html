                        At the National Children&rsquo;s Chorus, professionalism is exemplified on every level. This most certainly includes the

                            The NCC&rsquo;s performance attire design was modeled after outfits in the European tradition, and somewhat resembles that
                            of the TÃ¶lzer Knabenchor in Germany (arguably Europe&rsquo;s finest boychoir). The black knit
                            vests are embroidered with the NCC Apple logo with boys wearing flat-front black pants, and girls
                            in black pleated skirts. The crisp white shirt worn by both boys and girls features a slightly
                            thicker material that is resistant to wrinkling. Based on high ratings in customer service, garment
                            quality and excellent pricing,
                            <span class="ncc-transform-upper">Dennis</span> Uniform Company is the NCC&rsquo;s top choice to tailor the outfits.
