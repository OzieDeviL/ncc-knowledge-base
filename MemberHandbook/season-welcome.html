                        music, on the local, national and international level. We are immensely proud of how far our talented
                        young singers have come over the years, and triumphantly forge ahead with a renewed sense of joyful
                        determination.

                    <strong class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Building Bridges</strong>, Season 2017&#47;18 of the
                    <strong>National Children&rsquo;s Chorus</strong>, heralds a new era for the organization, as its gifted young
                    singers joyfully embrace their role as international ambassadors of peace and unity. In an unprecedented
                    line-up of extraordinary repertoire, Artistic Director Luke McEndarfer and Associate Artistic Director
                    Dr. Pamela Blackstone lead more than 600 young voices across the nation, as &ldquo;America&rsquo;s leading
                    choral institution for youth&rdquo; continues its meteoric trajectory. Following stunning appearances
                    this past summer at St. Mark&rsquo;s Basilica in Venice, St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica at the Vatican, and
                    St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Music Conservatory in Rome, NCC students embody, more than ever, the organization&rsquo;s
                    mission of artistic excellence, cultural openness and social justice. In its 3<sup>rd</sup> major performance at New York&rsquo;s Lincoln Center, NCC Senior Division ensembles from Los
                    Angeles, New York and Washington, D.C. come together in December for
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Winter Dream</span>, rejoicing in music by Randall Thompson, Eric Whitacre, Sarah Quartel, John Rutter
                    and Sharon Farber.
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Prism</span> will be presented at New York&rsquo;s Carnegie Hall in April, and Los Angeles&rsquo; Royce
                    Hall in May, celebrating American heritage and the richness of our nation&rsquo;s diversity. Selections
                    include a tribute to Leonard Bernstein, as part of our partnership with the Los Angeles Philharmonic
                    and
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Bernstein at 100</span>, as well as an on-stage collaboration in Los Angeles with
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Tonality</span>, a professional chamber choir, led by Principal Assistant Conductor Alexander Lloyd Blake.
                    Remembering the NCC&rsquo;s pledge to forge human connections and bring people together through music,
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Building Bridges</span> will conclude in the summer of 2018, when NCC students begin their 4<sup>th</sup> international
                    tour in Berlin, Germany, a city once divided by a wall until its 1989 reunification. The tour will continue
                    with additional performances throughout other key European cities, including Vienna, Prague and Budapest.

                    York, with the combined ranks of Senior Division ensembles taking the stage together at Lincoln Center&rsquo;s
                    Alice Tully Hall. Led by Maestro Luke McEndarfer and Dr. Pamela Blackstone, the exquisite musical program
                    pays homage to the beauty of rural America in romanticized wintry depictions, while modern composers
                    set the tone for a future filled with hope, redemption and the eternal promise of light. Sophisticated,
                    contemplative and stirring, the concert repertoire highlights some of the most ravishing works of living
                    composers, including
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Sleep</span> by Eric Whitacre, as well as the World and East Coast Premieres of a new piece by noted
                    film and concert composer, Sharon Farber. The Scholars, NCC&rsquo;s college-prep ensemble, give tribute
                    to Randall Thompson in his classic setting of poems by Robert Frost, comprised of seven country songs,
                    entitled
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Frostiana</span>. The Premier Ensemble, NCC&rsquo;s top-level treble group, “one of the finest children&rsquo;s
                    choirs in the world today," excitedly presents Sarah Quartel&rsquo;s choral sensation,
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Snow Angel</span>, with piano, cello obbligato and percussion. Having received performances at prestigious
                    events this past year, such as the ACDA National Conference in Minneapolis, and across the world,
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Snow Angel</span> makes its Lincoln Center debut with the NCC.
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Snow Angel's</span> libretto thoughtfully explores the themes of love, rebirth and beauty through the
                    eyes of children, and the heavenly army of angels that watch over them. The Debut Ensemble, NCC&rsquo;s
                    first level in the Senior Division, makes its mark with rousing holiday selections and arrangements by
                    John Leavitt and Wayne Bisbee, as well as Ruth Morris&rsquo; striking piece,

                    of and by immigrants from around the world, unified by an unstoppable vision for a better life. Here
                    we honor the powerfully heartfelt words inscribed on our Statue of Liberty, penned by Emma Lazarus in
                    1883: &ldquo;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.&rdquo; At Royce
                    Hall in Los Angeles and Carnegie Hall in New York,
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Prism</span> offers a season finale like no other, with music designed to connect all audience members
                    in an evening of joy, love and acceptance. Diversity will be celebrated in many forms, with timeless
                    classics and modern renditions, creating new musical connections and bringing forth a call for national
                    and global unity. In Los Angeles,
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Prism</span> features an on-stage collaboration with
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Tonality</span>, led by Alexander Lloyd Blake, as his singers join our Scholars college-prep SATB ensemble.
                    Music by Leonard Bernstein will be part of the evening&rsquo;s musical offerings as the NCC commemorates
                    the centennial of the great American composer&rsquo;s birth.
