                    Each year in June, the NCC holds its annual Awards Ceremonies, both in Los Angeles and New York. These special events are
                    designed to honor and recognize the stellar accomplishments of our gifted students which have been realized
                    throughout the year. In celebration of the season, awards are given out for participation and other various
                    distinctions. As this event is of paramount importance to the students, providing a special occasion
                    to acknowledge their excellence, we ask that each NCC family makes sure to reserve this date several
                    months in advance to avoid any potential scheduling conflicts.
