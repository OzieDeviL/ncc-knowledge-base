                <p>Drawing from a wealth of experience and an intense personal commitment to the arts, NCC Executive Director
                    <strong>Cristina Demiany</strong> embodies a dynamic approach to artistic management that fully fuses efficiency
                    and creativity. A native of Southern California, Cristina attended UCLA and graduated summa cum laude
                    in 2004 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in art history. In the first quarter of her freshman year at UCLA,
                    she auditioned into the UCLA Chorale and developed a passion for choral singing. Under the baton of Donald
                    Neuen, Cristina performed an extensive repertoire of major works with the UCLA Chorale including Bach&rsquo;s
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Magnificat</span>, Beethoven&rsquo;s
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Missa Solemnis</span>, Mozart&rsquo;s Requiem, Beethoven&rsquo;s Symphony No. 9, Handel&rsquo;s
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Messiah</span>, and Verdi&rsquo;s Requiem. While at UCLA, Cristina also interned in the Islamic Art Department
                    at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where she organized a 600-piece collection of ancient artifacts.
                </p>
                <p>After graduating, Cristina traveled to Ecuador, where she spent a month volunteering for a conservation group
                    in the Galápagos Islands. Later that year, she completed a semester study abroad program at Oxford University
                    in the United Kingdom, where she wrote extensively on English Gothic Art and Architecture. During her
                    studies, Cristina auditioned into the Oxford Bach Choir, and performed Bach&rsquo;s
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Magnificat</span> in the Sheldonian Theatre under the direction of Nicholas Cleobury. Cristina credits
                    her time in England with her great love and appreciation for the unique techniques and traditions of
                    British choral music. In 2005, Cristina took part in an archaeological dig at a Bronze Age site in northern
                    Israel.
                </p>
                <p>In 2006, Cristina began vocal study with Michael Dean, Chair of the UCLA School of Music. That same year,
                    she was appointed administrator of the Music Department at La Cañada Presbyterian Church. In partnership
                    with the music director, Cristina created a monthly arts event series at the church, producing a diverse
                    program of concerts, theatre, and art installations. During this time, Cristina began studying graphic
                    design, and soon became Director of Design and Marketing for the music department and several other ministries
                    at the church.
                </p>
                <p>In the Fall of 2008, Cristina joined the staff of the Paulist Choristers of California and, in partnership
                    with Luke McEndarfer, launched the National Children&rsquo;s Chorus at the Broad Stage in 2009. Currently,
                    Cristina manages NCC concert production, creative development, rehearsal administration, financial operations,
                    recruitment, branding, marketing, and human resources. Her passion for work with the NCC derives from
                    the opportunity to impart her love of the arts to the shining potential of so many wonderful children.
                    Cristina divides her time between Los Angeles, New York, and Frankfurt, Germany, holding residence in
                    all three cities. In her spare time, she enjoys painting, singing, and writing poetry.

                <p>
                    <strong>Dr. Pamela Blackstone</strong>&rsquo;s life philosophy is &ldquo;let what you love be what you do.&rdquo;
                    Because of this, her teaching encompasses a passion not only for music itself, but for the process of
                    bringing it to life.</p>
                <p>Dr. Blackstone began her musical training as a pianist, violinist, singer and dancer in her hometown of Chicago,
                    Illinois. Her studies at the college level earned her a Bachelor of Music degree from the University
                    of Kansas in piano performance where she graduated valedictorian from the School of Fine Arts. Her primary
                    teachers included Dr. Jack Winerock and Claude Frank. While at KU, Dr. Blackstone attended the Aspen
                    Summer Music Festival and School studying piano and chamber music with Rita Sloan.</p>
                <p>Expanding her musical education to include her love of choral music, Dr. Blackstone received her Master of
                    Music degree in choral conducting from the University of Missouri, Kansas City Conservatory of Music,
                    studying under the tutelage of Dr. Eph Ehly. She also became the Director of Choral Activities at Westark
                    College in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and quickly established herself as a highly sought-after choral clinician,
                    judge and show choir choreographer throughout the Midwest.</p>
                <p>Dr. Blackstone completed her formal study with a Doctorate of Music degree in choral conducting from the
                    University of California Los Angeles studying under Donald Neuen. Throughout her conducting education,
                    she earned a multitude of competition awards and scholarships from organizations such as the American
                    Choral Directors Association and Choral Conductor&rsquo;s Guild. Dr. Blackstone was also the Assistant
                    Conductor of the Angeles Chorale and has taught choral and vocal music at UCLA, Santa Ana College and
                    church organizations across Southern California.</p>
                <p>Dr. Blackstone is a professional healing arts expert in the mediums of yoga, energy work, fitness and health.
                    Having trained in musical, physical and energetic disciplines, Dr. Blackstone incorporates an eclectic
                    variety of teaching methodologies which inspire her students mentally, emotionally and kinesthetically.
                    Far beyond that, Dr. Blackstone brings her singers an expansive and inspiring energy which throughout
                    her life, has been called &ldquo;positively contagious.&rdquo; In the NCC, she has pioneered a fusion
                    of her healing arts and musical expertise, creating a class entitled &ldquo;You are the Instrument: Yoga
                    for Singers.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Dr. Blackstone joined the NCC Artistic Team in January 2009 and is honored to be part of a world-class organization.
                    For almost twenty years, Dr. Blackstone has been dedicated to teaching choral music across the country
                    to children and adults alike. She has concluded from her extensive experience that whether a musician
                    is five or ninety-five years old, beautiful music is a tangible expression of one&rsquo;s soul which
                    must be honorably executed with the nest technique, purity of mind and passion of heart.</p>

                    <strong>Ryan De Korte</strong> was born into a West Michigan family whose members make up an eclectic mix of
                    operatic tenors, concert violinists, nurses and distinguished law enforcement professionals. These roots
                    provided the foundation for his present career path, where he excels at creative organization and artistic
                    administration.
                </p>
                <p>Ryan&rsquo;s musical endeavors began at a young age with singing and performing in both school and church-produced
                    productions. Piano lessons, hand bell choir, as well as playing the trumpet, rounded out his musical
                    education. Through the years, Ryan has performed as a first tenor with various ensembles and traveled
                    extensively on tour, both to Western Europe and South America.</p>
                <p>At Hope College, he was one of the first two freshman ever to receive admittance to its chamber chorale,
                    with which he toured throughout the country. Currently a member of the Gay Men&rsquo;s Chorus of Los
                    Angeles, Ryan is a regularly featured performer in concert events that boast collaboration with top stars,
                    such as such as Linda Ronstadt, Melissa Manchester and LeAnn Rimes.</p>
                <p>Ryan&rsquo;s penchant for the skills required to excel at administration in the creative arts took hold in
                    college, having studied extensively in the sciences and receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in English
                    literature. In 1997, Ryan moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, and
                    secured a job with the Writers Guild of America, West. There, he successfully brought his own brand of
                    administrative creativity to the productions of the Writers Guild Awards for more than seven years. This
                    ultimately led to his work with The Academy of Motion Pictures and the Oscar telecast for an additional
                    four years.</p>
                <p>In the fall of 2011, Ryan joined the Administrative Team of the National Children&rsquo;s Chorus where he
                    enjoys his work immensely. In his spare time, Ryan takes joy in pottery, travel, and a good nap. </p>

                    drumline, musical theatre, opera, and more. Her experiences in music and with youth encouraged her to
                    pursue a degree in music education at California State University Northridge. While in college, Callirgos
                    continued to explore many genres of music through ensembles such as vocal jazz, African ensemble, master
                    chorale and wind ensemble. Continuing at CSUN, Kelly completed the credential program with high honors
                    and began teaching at a K-8 school called CHIME Charter Community School. For the last six years, Ms.
                    Callirgos has built up CHIME&rsquo;s music program from its beginnings. During the summers, she continues

                    completed two levels of Kodály as well as both levels of Folk Song Research. Last year, she also participated
                    in a traditional drumming, singing and dance program in Ghana. Kelly Callirgos is excited to extend her

                    a guitarist, he performed extensively and recorded with the de Falla Guitar Trio, a group he co-founded.

                    was awarded &ldquo;One of the Year&rsquo;s 12 Best&rdquo; for 1984 by Stereo Review. His principal teachers

                    at Indiana University at South Bend with Barton McLean, and David Barton, were later augmented with those
                    at USC with Earle Brown, William Kraft, and Leonard Rosenman, as well as masterclasses with Pierre Boulez
                    and Witold Lutoslawski. Dr. Krouse holds a Bachelor of Music degree, and Performer&rsquo;s and Composer&rsquo;s

                    mentorship of undergraduate students. Throughout his long career he has mentored several generations
                    of young people, many of whom have gone on to important careers in music and allied fields. Several of
                    his students have won prestigious awards such as the Prix de Rome, and the ASCAP and BMI Awards to Student
                    Composers, among many others. Today Professor Krouse is a seasoned and sought-after master teacher of
                    composition, theory, musicianship, analysis and conducting, with a thriving private studio to augment
                    his work at UCLA. He resides in Southern California with his three children.</p>
