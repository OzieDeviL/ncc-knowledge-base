                        career as a solo artist.

                        <p>
                            Ideally, students will come to the NCC at the age of five (5), joining the Prelude Level, and will advance through the ranks
                            of the program before graduating from the Scholars and Premier Ensemble at the age of seventeen
                            (17). Accordingly, once per Season, our directors come together in a meeting to discuss which
                            students, if any, should advance to the next level of the NCC.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Several factors are taken under consideration when making this decision:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Age *</li>
                            <li>Skill Level *</li>
                            <li>Behavioral Maturity *</li>
                            <li>Group Dynamics *</li>
                            <li>Attendance and Overall Performance</li>
                            <li>Quality in Past Rehearsals and Concerts</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            While age is the only factor above that is not controllable, a student&rsquo;s excellent or poor showing in the other areas
                            will either accelerate or delay receiving a promotion. Promotions are handled individually and
                            confidentially, with no announcements going out to the organization or public. All notices shall
                            be transmitted directly to the parent(s) of the student via e-mail by the Executive Director.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, it is paramount that each student is in a place where he or she may grow and benefit most effectively, with the
                            best chance of success. It goes without saying that moving a student up prematurely can be damaging
                            to his or her experience of music, which is why careful attention is paid to this process by
                            our entire NCC Artistic Team. It is our goal to move each student up when it is the right time.
                            If you feel your child is due for a promotion, but have not received notice of one, you may always
                            e-mail the director and inquire over his or her current status. Our directors are very open with
                            NCC parents in terms of assessing a given student&rsquo;s place on the journey of achievement,
                            so questions and inquiries are fully welcomed.
