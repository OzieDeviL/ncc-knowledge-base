                            Students in the National Children&rsquo;s Chorus are given the opportunity to audition for solo roles as they naturally come
                            up within the course of the performance season. Solo assignments are based on skill level and
                            determined by the needs of the musical production as deemed appropriate by the ensemble&rsquo;s
                            director, or a panel of judges. Not every student will qualify to receive a solo assignment,
                            and some students may qualify for several. It must be clearly understood that the NCC is a
                            <strong>chorus</strong> (not a solo studio), and singing solo at an NCC event is not a guaranteed experience.
                            With that in mind, the NCC ardently supports the vocal development of each singer and enthusiastically
                            offers the right solo experiences for students when they become ready.

                                him or her will be relieved of the solo which will then be reassigned to another student,

                                to another student.

                            are very busy professionals, lastminute, stressful requests put a strain on their schedules,
                            and therefore cannot be allowed. For this reason, any request made within 30 days may be declined.
                            As it is our wish to support your children in the best way possible, we kindly ask that you enable
                            us to do so by submitting your request in a timely manner.

                            on time comes at an added, hourly cost to the organization. Since some students do not ever ask
                            for recommendation processing, and others ask for several letters, it is only fair that we charge

                            One time per season, the NCC holds auditions for new members, both in Los Angeles and New York. For these events, in addition
                            to testing the skills of prospective singers, the NCC introduces both new parents and students
                            to the organization by way of interaction with our own NCC members. If your child is selected
                            to represent the NCC at one of our regional auditions, you will be contacted by NCC Administration.
                            Thereafter, once the engagement has been agreed upon, he or she will be expected to adhere to
                            the following&mdash;
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Must arrive 15 minutes prior to the beginning of the audition start time.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Must be dressed in NCC Formal Dress, including all grooming requirements.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Must meet and greet prospective parents and students.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Must participate in the audition posture and vocalizing demonstration.
                            </li>

                                Must sing a piece of music, or speak a few words about the NCC experience.

                    Each month (October through May) a single student from each ensemble will receive the coveted Golden Apple Award. During
                    the process of rehearsing each month, directors keep track of performance excellence by awarding points
                    for good behavior, superb musicianship, participation and improvement. The student with the greatest
                    achievement for each month shall be honored with a special award (limit one per student per performance
                    year, multiple months as winner not allowed). Additionally, he or she is given recognition for this distinction
                    at the Awards Ceremony at the end of the year, along with a special certificate.
