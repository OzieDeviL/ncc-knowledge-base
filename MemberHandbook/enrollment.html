                            For your convenience, the NCC offers monthly tuition payments with an easy online sign-up process. For a one-time set-up
                            fee of $45, our secure system will automatically deduct a monthly payment from your debit or
                            credit card, allowing you to spread your payments over twelve (12) months, increasing affordability
                            and flexibility to families that prefer it. Here are some important things to remember when signing
                            up for monthly tuition payments (

                                Once the enrollment contract is signed, you are legally committed to paying the full year&rsquo;s tuition, regardless of
                                whether your child leaves the program or not.

                                Monthly payments are made over twelve (12) months, even though the NCC performance season is over ten (10) months; this is
                                done to make the monthly amount less, and create additional affordability for you. This may
                                mean that you see charges for July and August (when the NCC is not in session), depending
                                on when you began your twelve (12) month contract.
