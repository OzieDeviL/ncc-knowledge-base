                                Upon arrival, parents are asked to enter the church office, and proceed immediately to Room 101 (first door on the right).
                                Please do not wait or congregate in the lobby.

                                Approach the Check-in Desk with the NCC sign, where NCC Authorized Personnel will document the Check-in, and point your child
                                in the right direction. Please do not wait or congregate in Room 101&mdash;Check-in must
                                be fast and efficient. Parents are not permitted within the limits of the secured area.

                                As soon as your child is checked-in, kindly vacate the building as quickly as possible, in order to avoid congestion in Room
                                101, and allow other students checking in to have the space they need to do so. Please do
                                not wait around or congregate in Room 101 or the lobby. Because of the small amount of space,
                                and the large number of students, parents are not permitted to stay on-site at any point
                                during the rehearsal process.
                            </li>

                                Check-in procedures at Room 101 will conclude at precisely 4:27 PM, at which time the room must be completely vacated, except
                                for instructors and students. At this point, the door to Room 101 shall be closed, instructors
                                and students shall take their places for rehearsal and all other check-ins shall be handled
                                from the entrance to the lobby. Again, please do not congregate in the lobby, or anywhere
                                on-site. As soon as your child is checked-in, please quickly vacate the building to avoid
                                congestion within the small amount of space we have to accomplish these large-scale operations.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                For all check-ins at 4:27 PM or later, please approach NCC Authorized Personnel in the lobby, where he or she will document
                                your child&rsquo;s check-in, while another Parent Chaperone escorts your child to his or
                                her rehearsal room.

                    in Self Check-outs, and his or her name will be added to the authorized list that the director will see

                            As described above, the job of watching over the NCC&rsquo;s student body is vital. At the NCC, student safety is the number
                            one priority, and therefore we take very seriously all issues pertaining to it. Accordingly,
                            please be mindful of the days you have signed up for, marking them in your calendars, and making
                            sure never to fail in showing up on time. NCC Administration will send you an e-mail reminder
                            prior to any day for which you have signed up, and the Weekly Reminder will list your name under
                            &ldquo;Chaperones.&rdquo;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If for any reason you are unable to make it, please contact another NCC parent to replace yourself and have your shift covered,
                            notifying our office of the change. It is never acceptable to sign up as a Parent Chaperone,
                            and simply not show up. A lack of chaperone assistance at any given event puts our student body
                            in potential danger, and therefore cannot be permitted.
                        </p>

                    At all levels of the NCC (Prelude through Scholars), our instructors teach new and varied material at each session, and at
                    a fast pace. Accordingly, even one missed session results in a significant loss of learning. Through
                    years of experience, we have observed that when attendance dips below 80%, unacceptable signs of unpreparedness
                    typically begin to manifest and students are no longer able perform at the professional level that is
                    expected of our organization. As a result, it is imperative that a strict code of attendance and punctuality
                    be observed.

                            Students are to be in place five (5) minutes before the start time of any session, and must stay for its entirety. As latecomers
                            miss important material and disrupt the rehearsal underway, we ask that punctuality be made a
                            top priority for each NCC family. Since arriving late is deemed highly unprofessional and unacceptable
                            in the real world of working musicians, please make sure to support your children&rsquo;s learning
                            of what it truly takes to succeed by getting them there on time. They will one day thank you

                            lives. Tech Rehearsals, however, comprise the one period prior to any major performance where
                            we need the students&rsquo; schedules to bend to the needs of the ensemble, and lend time additionally

                            calendars of other activities, and minimizing their work to just school and the NCC. If this
                            means postponing parties, events and outings to a different time, then please do so. We need
                            their time during Tech Rehearsals, and we also need your cooperation in making sure they get
                            ample rest for the performance, which usually means trimming down other activities.

                            the NCC experience to be hassle-free and enjoyable for you too. Therefore, we urge you to take
                            the time to carefully go through the schedule, making sure there are no conflicts with your family
                            calendars, and that all planning issues are dealt with as far in advance as possible. Helping

                    Nutritious snacks are always recommended by te NCC for consumption during break and after rehearsal. Food with whole grains
                    and high in fiber allow a steady release of sugar into the bloodstream and prevent our students from
                    experiencing a sugar high, followed by a sharp drop in energy. As singing requires a great deal of mental
                    focus and physical endurance, a proper diet rich in nutrients is very important.

                    all devices at home on the day of the dress rehearsal and performance.

                <p>
                    Imagine that you are working efficiently on a project alone in a room. Everything required for your project is in the room,
                    and you are in a place where you can create freely with no fear of judgment. About an hour into your
                    work, a friend and someone you don&rsquo;t know unexpectedly enters the room, and wishes to watch you
                    at work. Though the same work exists in front of you, something has definitely changed. Instead of your
                    entire consciousness focusing freely on the work itself, you are now intently aware that you are being
                    watched and you begin to cater your work to meet the satisfaction of those watching, thereby somewhat
                    inhibiting the free creative space that existed before they entered. You are a professional, and very
                    good at what you do, so you can handle this and still do a good job. But on some level, you know that
                    your work could have been better if your friend and other person weren&rsquo;t there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is exactly the type of thing that happens when people come to observe the NCC at work. Our directors and students are
                    skilled enough to do a good job under any social circumstance, but it cannot be denied by either directors
                    or students that observation prior to the final product inhibits the freedom to make mistakes, try new
                    things and take the chance of looking or sounding bad&mdash;the very thing that ultimately leads an artist
                    or ensemble to discovering the very best and most brilliant work they have to offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this reason, rehearsals at the NCC are &ldquo;closed.&rdquo; This means that other than our Artistic Team and students,
                    visitors are not allowed as a general rule. Exceptions must always be cleared in advance with the ensemble&rsquo;s
                    director who must be given the opportunity to strategize for the temporary loss of artistic freedom as
                    described above. If you have an important reason to view an NCC rehearsal, or if you have someone in
                    mind that you feel needs to see our process, contact the group&rsquo;s director who, depending on the
                    situation, may or may not be able to accommodate your request.

                        <!-- protocol for performance days subsection content-->
                        <p>
                            All of us at the NCC&mdash;students, parents, and Artistic Team members&mdash;want the best performance possible. It is what
                            we strive for and work towards at every rehearsal week to week. Accordingly, we place all of
                            our focus on the student performers, making sure they have what they need in order to deliver
                            the finest performance possible. But there is another performer whose musical job the night of
                            the concert is of tremendous difficulty and extreme importance&mdash;the conductor. With so much
                            emphasis placed on the performers who are actually singing or playing, the role of the conductor
                            can sometimes be taken for granted or entirely forgotten. And yet if a conductor were to miss
                            a single cue, or fail to properly indicate any given musical entrance, the outcome would be disastrous&mdash;in
                            fact, a piece of music might have to be completely stopped and restarted as a result, in front
                            of the audience. Now consider that in a given concert, a conductor will have to encounter upwards
                            of five hundred similar instances, all with the same crucial degree of importance. We could call
                            this &ldquo;multi-tasking at its ultimate level,&rdquo; otherwise known as the job of musical
                            conducting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the time a conductor reaches the final moments prior to a performance, he or she is swimming among countless musical details,
                            mentally going over them time and time again. At this point, the level of concentration and focus
                            required to succeed is extraordinary, and takes every ounce of effort and energy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Knowing and understanding what is going on with the conductor just prior to a performance suddenly changes one&rsquo;s perspective,
                            and immediately makes it obvious to observe the following courteous protocol the day of the performance
                            so that the conductor is allowed to be &ldquo;in the zone&rdquo; and not distracted:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Do not call the conductor.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Do not text the conductor.

                            <li>
                                Do not e-mail the conductor.

                            <li>
                                Do not approach the conductor or engage him or her in any conversation beyond &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; should you see him or
                                her prior to the performance in the parking lot, concert hall lobby, backstage, artist entrance,
                                or anywhere in passing.

                        <p>
                            Now, here is something that may come as a surprise. A musical rehearsal, even a weekly rehearsal, takes almost as much focus
                            and concentration on the part of the conductor as a performance. Our directors are very ambitious,
                            and tremendously efficient, which means that each rehearsal is planned down to the minute, and
                            must be executed to perfection if superb concert preparation over the weeks is to be accomplished.
                            Again, knowing what is going on with the conductor just prior to any rehearsal immediately makes
                            it obvious to observe the following courteous protocol the day of a rehearsal:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Do not call the conductor.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Do not text the conductor.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                E-mailing the conductor is OK on a rehearsal day, but a response may not happen until the following day.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Do not approach the conductor or engage him or her in any conversation beyond &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; should you see him or her
                                prior to the rehearsal.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If there is an emergency, please contact the Executive Administrator, who will pass the information along to the conductor
                                if necessary and appropriate.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                            Ok, I understand. But if I can&rsquo;t approach the director before or after any rehearsal or performance, does that mean
                            he or she is never available to speak with me about my issue?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No, to the contrary. Our directors are extremely available to discuss any and all issues you feel are important to you. Simply
                            send an e-mail to the director with whom you wish to meet, request to schedule an appointment,
                            and an appropriate time will be set to give you and your child the level of attention you require.
                            Either by phone, or in person, our directors are always happy to be of service in the best possible
                            way.
