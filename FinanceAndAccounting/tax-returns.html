                    (officially, the &ldquo;Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax&rdquo;). This
                    is a United States Internal Revenue Service form that provides the public with financial information
                    about a nonprofit organization. Filing this document in the public record ensures transparency in non-profit
                    financial procedures to make sure that funds are managed appropriately. Completing the annual tax return
                    is required by law and must be completed within certain time parameters. This important project is a
                    critical component of our company&rsquo;s financial procedures; grant applications for funding are not
                    possible without a current 990 on file in the public record.</p>

                        <a href="http://missionwell.com/">Missionwell Accounting Firm</a> will finalize all financial reports for that fiscal year. The financial
                        reports must be checked by a controller and all revenue and expenses verified as correct before the
                        books can be closed on the fiscal year.</li>
                    <li>Once all financials for the fiscal year are finalized, the independent auditing firm
                        <a href="http://www.rsjcpa.com/">Rose, Snyder and Jacobs</a> should be contacted by e-mail in August or early September to open

                    <li>Form 990 must be filed by the 15<sup>th</sup> day of the 5<sup>th</sup> month after the end of our organization&rsquo;s accounting
                        period. Thus, for the NCC&rsquo;s fiscal year ending June 30<sup>th</sup>, Form 990 is due November 15<sup>th</sup> of
                        the same year.</li>
