                    <p>Each year, an independent auditing firm reviews all financial procedures of the National Children’s Chorus,
                        issuing a full report for the Board of Directors and potential donors. An annual audit is required by
                        the states of California and New York when a non-profit reaches certain levels of annual revenue. The
                        audit is an important pillar of the financial architecture which supports our organization.

                        <li>When the NCC’s fiscal year concludes on the 30th of June each year, <a href="http://missionwell.com">Missionwell Accounting Firm</a> will
                            finalize all financial reports for that fiscal year. The financial reports must be checked by a controller
                            and all revenue and expenses verified as correct before the books can be closed on the fiscal year.</li>
                        <li>Once all financials for the fiscal year are finalized, the independent auditing firm <a href="http://www.rsjcpa.com/">Rose, Snyder and
                            Jacobs</a> should be contacted by e-mail in August or early September to open discussion on the annual
                            audit.
                        </li>
                        <li>Our primary contact at RSJ is <a href="mailto:emadathian@rsjcpa.com">Evlina Madathian</a>.</li>
                        <li>The auditors will provide a quote for the audit and an <a href="https://dzf8vqv24eqhg.cloudfront.net/userfiles/12157/15548/ckfinder/files/FinanceAndAccounting/PerformingAnAnnualAudit/NCC%20RSJ%20-%202017%20and%202016%20Audit%20Engagement%20Letter.pdf">engagement letter</a>, which must be signed by the
                            organization.
                        </li>
                        <li>The auditors will provide a <a href="https://dzf8vqv24eqhg.cloudfront.net/userfiles/12157/15548/ckfinder/files/FinanceAndAccounting/PerformingAnAnnualAudit/Planning%20Document%20Request%20List%20Audits.xls">Planning Document Request List</a> of what they will need for the audit.</li>
                        <li>Once the engagement letter has been signed, Missionwell Accounting Firm should be notified that their
                            services will be needed to help with the Audit. The CEO of Missionwell, <a href="mailto:caryn@missionwell.com">Caryn Ryan</a>, will assist in
                            a quote for the hours which will be required to complete the audit. Audit work is a separate cost
                            from our fixed monthly fee for Missionwell’s accounting services. </li>
                        <li>Once a quote for audit work is agreed upon with Missionwell, a conference call is set up between NCC,
                            Missionwell, and the Auditors.</li>
                        <li>The Auditors explain their initial needs for documents and reports to the Missionwell accountant. Notes
                            are taken during the call and sent out to all participants afterwards for reference.</li>
                        <li>Weekly conference calls are held to check in on the audit, and the NCC and Missionwell work together
                            to supply all requested materials.</li>
                        <li>Supplying all materials and meeting the Auditors’ requests can take several months. Involvement of multiple
                            NCC departments is required, as the Auditors often request detail on specific students’ tuition accounts,
                            or information on a particular donor or donation.</li>
                        <li>The Auditors will also need all information on our investments with Merrill Lynch. Our contact at Merrill
                            Lynch is <a href="mailto:arin.babakhanian@ml.com">Arin Babakhanian</a>.</li>
                        <li>The goal is to complete the annual audit by the end of the NCC’s Fall Season (mid-December of each year).</li>
                        <li>Once the audit is complete, the Auditors will issue both digital and printed copies of their audited
                            financial statements, as well as a final summary of their findings. Copies of these should be presented
                            to the Board of Directors, the NCC Grant Writer, and kept on file at Missionwell.</li>
