                    can be embarrassing and very costly, careful attention must paid to checking the accuracy of all listed

                <p>Each marketing piece should be proofed multiple times by a person other than the author prior to approval.
                    Check the marketing piece both on the computer screen, and also print out a physical copy (you may often
                    catch errors in the printed copy which you did not at first detect on a computer screen). No changes
                    or edits should be made without another full proofing of the entire work, as a small change in one area
                    could cause an error in another. A final full proof by both author and proofer with no errors should
                    always be the last and final step before approval.
                </p>
                <p>When content proofing, here are the areas that should be carefully checked:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spelling and listing of names.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spelling errors are more easily detected in known words. But when it comes to names, errors can
                                happen and go undetected rather easily. And yet, misspelling the name of a student or an
                                important donor can be one of the most unforgiving mistakes possible, with disastrous consequences.
                                When it comes to the spelling of people&rsquo;s names,
                                <strong>triple check</strong> every single name against an accurate list by printing out both the
                                original list of names and the marketing piece. Verify each one back and forth, carefully
                                looking at spellings, then cross the name off both lists to indicate to yourself that the
                                name is correct before moving on to the next.
                            </li>
                            <li>After verifying the spelling of each name, then you must ensure that all names in a given list
                                have been included in the marketing piece. Accidentally forgetting to include someone&rsquo;s
                                name can have disastrous results (such as forgetting to list a student performer, or a donor
                                who has contributed to the organization). Go through each name one at a time, and check the
                                name off on the original list, comparing it to the printed out PDF of the marketing piece,
                                making sure that none of the names have been forgotten.
                            </li>
                            <li>When spelling the name of schools, venues, streets, places, make sure to verify the spelling
                                by looking up the name online whenever necessary.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Proper listing of dates, times and other numerical information, such as addresses and pricing.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Double check all data on the marketing piece to ensure that it is correct. Getting the concert
                                date or time wrong after a printing has been done may result in thousands of dollars in reprinting
                                fees. Again, incorrect data on a marketing piece is disastrous and costly.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Fact checking.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure that all claims made on a marketing piece are true and consistent with what the organization
                                has communicated in the past. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Consistency of listings and presentation.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure that the way content is presented is done so exactly the same way throughout a marketing
                                piece. For instance, if an abbreviation is used on one page, and then the full word on another
                                page, the presentation lacks consistency. Whatever way something is done, it should be done
                                the same way throughout. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Relevant information.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consult the &ldquo;relevant information&rdquo; page in this knowledge tool to verify that all
                                required information has been included in any given marketing piece. For instance, it would
                                be a disaster if a concert flier were printed and the venue address not listed. As another
                                example, it would be a disaster if a concert program were printed and a sponsor&rsquo;s full
                                page ad (which the sponsor was promised) were omitted. Every marketing piece has required
                                elements, and ensuring that all are included are part of the content proofing.</li>

                    If content proofing is done well, each NCC marketing piece will perfectly list all needed and relevant information. Content
                    proofing is less creative and more methodical than copy proofing or design proofing. But it is perhaps
                    the most important proofing to be done. Any errors in the content, especially the misspelling or omission
                    of a person&rsquo;s name, may result in extreme embarrassment and possibly large financial losses for
                    the organization. It cannot be stressed enough how crucial it is that all data be verified as
                    <strong>perfect</strong> prior to approval.
