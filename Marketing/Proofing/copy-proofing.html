                <p>Each piece of copy should be proofed multiple times by a person other than the author prior to approval.
                    Check the copy both on the computer screen, and also print out a physical copy (you may often catch errors
                    in the printed copy which you did not at first detect on a computer screen). No changes or edits should
                    be made without another full proofing of the entire work, as a small change in one area could cause an
                    error in another. A final full proof by both author and proofer with no errors should always be the last
                    and final step before approval. </p>
                <p>When proofing, here are the areas that should be carefully checked:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Spelling</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spelling errors are symptomatic of a lack of professionalism, and always reflect poorly on an organization.
                            Every word must be correctly spelled.
                        </li>
                        <li>Check each word by eye individually for spelling accuracy, reading the piece both forwards and backwards.
                        </li>
                        <li>When reading forwards, make sure spelling is correct not only individually, but in context of what
                            is being said. For instance, &ldquo;peak&rdquo; individually is spelled correctly, but it is
                            incorrectly spelled when talking of a &ldquo;sneak
                            <strong>peek</strong>.&rdquo; The same thing applies to &ldquo;premier&rdquo; versus &ldquo;premiere.&rdquo;
                        </li>
                        <li>When reading backwards, start at the end and check each word by itself. This will often help you
                            catch errors your eye did not see when reading forwards.
                        </li>
                        <li>Make sure to run a computer spellcheck for good measure.
                        </li>
                        <li>Be careful of &quot;auto-correct,&quot; which can change correctly-spelled words to incorrect, and
                            be sure to verify the final PDF or final version of anything prior to approval.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you are ever unsure about the spelling or syntax of any word you see, look it up and double-check.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Grammar and Punctuation
                        <ul>
                            <li>Grammatical errors are symptomatic of a lack of professionalism, and always reflect poorly on
                                an organization. Grammar and punctuation must be correct, except in unique circumstances
                                when an exception is made on purpose for stylistic reasons.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Vocabulary
                        <ul>
                            <li>Word choice is very important because words are impactful and influential. Therefore, special
                                attention must be paid to the words used when we communicate on behalf of the NCC.
                            </li>
                            <li>Descriptive words should be exciting, displaying creativity and intelligence. They should not,
                                however, be inaccessible or cause confusion to the average person. Any word that the average
                                person would need to look up in a dictionary should be avoided, as it can come across as
                                disconnected, out of touch, or pretentious. The goal is to create beautiful, compelling statements
                                while still remaining 100&#37; accessible.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Repeated Words
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some words must be repeated in a writing piece, such as &ldquo;the&rdquo; or &ldquo;and.&rdquo;
                                Descriptive words, however, should not be repeated within a single writing piece, whenever
                                possible, such as &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; or &ldquo;amazing.&rdquo; When the same descriptive
                                word is used over and over, it does not come across as resourceful or creative, especially
                                when an author has the entire English language to work with.
                            </li>
                            <li>Any time a descriptive word is used, make sure to scan the entire writing piece to make sure
                                it did not get repeated.
                            </li>
                            <li>When you find a word that has been repeated, use your knowledge or a thesaurus to find alternate
                                words to use instead.
                            </li>

                            <li>Certain words are banned in any copy published by the NCC, because we do not want them associated
                                with our brand.</li>
                            <li>Below is a list, with possible substitutions to use instead.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>&ldquo;Kid&rdquo;/&ldquo;kids&quot; &mdash; Too casual for the NCC. Use &ldquo;child&rdquo;/&ldquo;children&rdquo;/&ldquo;singer&rdquo;/
                                        &ldquo;vocalist&rdquo;/&ldquo;student&rdquo;/&ldquo;chorister&rdquo;.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>&ldquo;Unfortunately&quot; &mdash; This word is disappointing and negative. Say &ldquo;as
                                        it turns out&rdquo;, or rephrase the information so that it doesn&rsquo;t sound &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo;.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>&ldquo;Change&rdquo; as in &ldquo;the schedule for this week has been
                                        <strong>changed</strong>&rdquo; &mdash; People don&rsquo;t like change and the word can be
                                        alarming. Say &ldquo;adjusted&rdquo; or rephrase the sentence to sound less dramatic:
                                        &ldquo;We have
                                        <strong>updated</strong> the uniform to include a black tie, which will enhance the professional
                                        image of our students&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;the uniform has been changed.&rdquo;
                                        Every piece of information we deliver must be presented in the most positive light
                                        possible. The exact same information can come across in very different ways, depending
                                        on how it is said.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                    <li>Phrasing
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sometimes, words in a sentence must be put into a slightly different order so that the writing
                                piece reads as smoothly as possible. Be aware of awkward sentence structure, and make sure
                                to correct it whenever it doesn&rsquo;t feel quite right.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>Flow
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each sentence should flow naturally into the next. Be aware of abrupt changes of subject, and
                                correct whenever something doesn&rsquo;t feel like it naturally follows. Make sure all transitions
                                are smooth. Here is an example of random sentences that
                                <strong>do not</strong> flow well together, and sound very scattered: &ldquo;This season, the students
                                will be working on head tone. Our 2<sup>nd</sup> piece in the concert is a piece of music by Bach. Remember
                                to go over the schedule carefully.&rdquo; Here is the same information, with
                                <strong>smoother</strong> transitions: &ldquo;This season, the students will be working on head
                                tone placement. This new technique will resound beautifully in our December concert, especially
                                on the 2<sup>nd</sup> piece of the program which was composed by J.S. Bach. As we progress over the
                                next few months towards this exciting holiday event, we ask that you review the schedule
                                regularly to ensure the most successful result.&rdquo;
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Tone
                        <ul>
                            <li>Professional copy of the NCC is geared towards a large audience of starkly different communities,
                                and must appeal to the unique desires and sensibilities of each.
                            </li>
                            <li>All published copy must be composed and proofed with these two groups most importantly in mind:
                                1) Parents and students (who may be new to the music world) 2) Classical music aficionados
                                and music professionals whose high opinion can heighten the NCC&rsquo;s profile and open
                                new opportunities.
                            </li>
                            <li>Junior Division parents are interested in knowing that their children are receiving a worthwhile
                                educational experience, that the NCC is a fun, nurturing and engaging environment, and that
                                their child&rsquo;s interest in music is being encouraged and enhanced. Junior Division parents
                                are not so impressed with the NCC&rsquo;s professional accomplishments, accolades, international
                                tours or prestigious concert hall appearances. At this level, the parents are especially
                                protective of their child&rsquo;s well-being and happiness, and prioritize this higher than
                                anything else. Performances at Carnegie Hall, for instance, are not so important or impressive
                                to parents of a 5-year-old. Instead, Junior Division parents love to hear how the NCC is
                                fun and engaging.
                            </li>
                            <li>Senior Division parents are also invested in their child&rsquo;s happiness, but have developed
                                more of a concern towards high school and college applications, as well as their child&rsquo;s
                                future. Prestigious concert halls, top-level performance experiences, high-level training,
                                and international tours become important to them, as they focus on making sure their children
                                are well-equipped for success. They also love the idea that the NCC works on building up
                                their child&rsquo;s confidence and creating a strong sense of self. Senior Division parents
                                are very motivated by the NCC&rsquo;s commitment to excellence, structure and high standards.
                            </li>
                            <li>Junior Division students will rarely read through NCC professional copy. However, Senior Division
                                students certainly read through it, and like their parents, are pleased by the NCC&rsquo;s
                                extraordinary musical projects. As they themselves are the artists, they take great pride
                                in the NCC and its accolades.

                            <li>Classical music aficionados and music professionals are not so interested in the NCC&rsquo;s
                                educational and people-building processes, but rather with the final product seen and heard
                                in concert. They are concerned with musical excellence, virtuosity, professionalism in sound
                                and imagery, as well as prestigious collaborations with big-name orchestras, adult choruses,
                                and composers with performances at world-class venues.

                            <li>A successful writing piece will be greatly appealing to all the groups listed above. The NCC
                                will come off as
                                <strong>both</strong> fun
                                <strong>and</strong> impressive. To proof, make sure to read it as each of the targeted audience
                                groups. Meaning, read it one time through as a Junior Division parent, once as a Senior Division
                                parent, once as a Senior Division student, and once as a classical music insider. Are you
                                fully contented and engaged when you read it as each? If not, the copy needs edits and/or
                                modifications. Excellent NCC copy will achieve a heightened impression of our organization
                                in every reader.
