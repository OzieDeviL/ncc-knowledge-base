                                        Spelling errors are symptomatic of a lack of professionalism, and always reflect poorly on an organization. Every word must
                                        be correctly spelled.

                                        Grammatical errors are symptomatic of a lack of professionalism, and always reflect poorly on an organization. Grammar and

                                        Word choice is very important because words are impactful and influential. Therefore, special attention must be paid to the
                                        words used when we communicate on behalf of the NCC.

                                        Descriptive words should be exciting, displaying creativity and intelligence. They should not, however, be inaccessible or
                                        cause confusion to the average person. Any word that the average person would need
                                        to look up in a dictionary should be avoided, as it can come across as disconnected,
                                        out of touch, or pretentious. The goal is to create beautiful, compelling statements
                                        while still remaining 100&#37; accessible.

                                    <li>
                                        Some words must be repeated in a writing piece, such as &ldquo;the&rdquo; or &ldquo;and.&rdquo;
                                        <strong>Descriptive words, however, should not be repeated within a single writing piece,
                                            whenever possible, such as &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; or &ldquo;amazing.&rdquo;</strong>
                                        When the same descriptive word is used over and over, it does not come across as resourceful or creative, especially when
                                        an author has the entire English language to work with.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Any time a descriptive word is used, make sure to scan the entire writing piece to make sure it did not get repeated.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        When you find a word that has been repeated, use your knowledge or a thesaurus to find alternate words to use instead.

                                        Sometimes, words in a sentence must be put into a slightly different order so that the writing piece reads as smoothly as
                                        possible. Be aware of awkward sentence structure, and make sure to correct it whenever
                                        it doesn&rsquo;t feel quite right.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Each sentence should flow naturally into the next. Be aware of abrupt changes of subject, and correct whenever something
                                        doesn&rsquo;t feel like it naturally follows. Make sure all transitions are smooth.
                                        Here is an example of random sentences that
                                        <strong>do not</strong> flow well together, and sound very scattered: &ldquo;This season,
                                        the students will be working on head tone. Our 2<sup>nd</sup> piece in the concert is a piece of music by Bach. Remember to go over the
                                        schedule carefully.&rdquo; Here is the same information, with
                                        <strong>smoother</strong> transitions: &ldquo;This season, the students will be working on
                                        head tone placement. This new technique will resound beautifully in our December
                                        concert, especially on the 2<sup>nd</sup> piece of the program which was composed by J.S. Bach. As we progress over
                                        the next few months towards this exciting holiday event, we ask that you review the
                                        schedule regularly to ensure the most successful result.&rdquo;

                                            confusion on the part of the members, as well as provide a consistent branding
                                            within our organization. Below is a list of official NCC names with samples of

                    If the Progress Message is done well, it will elicit a sense of delight, satisfaction and excitement in the parent who is
                    reading it, which, beyond making him or her happy, could potentially lead to increased ticket sales and
                    greater desire to donate to the NCC, further supporting our educational programs. As you can see, creating
                    the right dynamic is very important in expressing the culture of our brand, and has direct implications
                    to our bottom line (as does every interaction we have with our members). The Progress Message is a great
                    opportunity for you, our Associate Conductors, to connect with our parents and share the extraordinary
                    things you are creating with their children in the classroom each and every week.

                <p>
                    If the Progress Message is not done well, you will notice that many edits, changes and re-writing must take place, going
                    back and forth, usually at the expense of your time, as well as the time of our management team. This
                    is something ideally to be avoided. If the directions above are followed carefully, edits to the Progress
                    Message should be minimal or unnecessary.
