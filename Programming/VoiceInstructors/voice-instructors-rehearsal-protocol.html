                                end are denied their lesson, causing possible disappointment, and lessening the
                                productivity of an instructor&rsquo;s time at the NCC).

                                This means that no matter what time a student arrives for his or her session, it must end exactly on time. &nbsp;For
                                instance, in Los Angeles, our first sessions of the day look like this:â€‹

                            </li>

                                Student #1 is sent to the lesson space at 1:00&nbsp;PM. He or she may arrive at 1:01.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The lesson starts, and as soon as the clock turns 1:10, he or she is sent back to rehearsal.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once Student #1 returns to rehearsal, Student #2 automatically stands, and proceeds to the lesson space.

                                Student #2 may arrive in the lesson space at 1:11. Still, his or her lesson must end at 1:20. We just want to be clear that
                                it is the end-time that must be precise in order to keep the students on schedule.
