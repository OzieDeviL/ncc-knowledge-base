                        <ul>
                            <li>Whenever possible, scores will be sent to the pianist a minimum of two (2) weeks in advance of
                                the 1<sup>st</sup> rehearsal.</li>
                            <li>Make sure to prepare the accompaniment at home, and spend time studying and practicing the score.</li>
                            <li>In addition to learning the notes, it is highly recommended to listen to recordings of the piece
                                whenever possible so that the pianist is not just hitting notes on the page, but actually
                                knows how the piece should sound, as well as be familiar with the character of the music.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>For instance, if a pianist has been sent an SSA arrangement of <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Lacrymosa</span> from Mozart&#39;s
                                        <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Requiem</span>, he or she should listen to this movement from the original Mozart <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work">Requiem</span>,
                                        in order to get a strong sense of how this music was originally conceived by the
                                        composer. This will help shape how the pianist translates the adapted arrangement,
                                        recreating the features of the original orchestration.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Unless a pianist has just been given the music on the spot, the quality of playing should never
                                feel like &ldquo;sight-reading.&rdquo; The music should feel polished, artistically/sensitively
                                executed, and fully-prepared.</li>
                            <li>With every score, pianists must be ready to do any of the following if/when requested by the
                                conductor:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Play the piece through as a piano solo, demonstrating for the students how the full score
                                        should sound, showing the beautiful features of the music, combining BOTH the accompaniment
                                        and the vocal lines.</li>
                                    <li>Play one or more vocal lines at a time without the accompaniment.</li>
                                    <li>Play one or more vocal lines at a time, while playing as much of the accompaniment as
                                        possible.
                                    </li>

                                just loudly enough for the singers to hear the notes, but nothing more.</li>
                            <li>Make sure to watch the conductor closely during any tempo changes, measures marked with ritardando,

                            <li>When playing individual lines, unless otherwise directed by the conductor, always play other
                                prominent musical lines happening in the music at the same time, so that the singers get
                                a sense of where they are, how their line fits into what else is going on in the score, and
                                what they can expect to hear once the entire thing is put together.</li>
                            <li>Make sure to always have a pencil on hand, to make any pertinent notations in the score, as well
                                as any errors/problems that you may wish to draw to the conductor&rsquo;s attention.</li>
                            <li>Make sure to have any mobile phones silenced and put away during the rehearsal; outside of emergency,
                                use of such devices in front of the students is not permitted except at the break.</li>
