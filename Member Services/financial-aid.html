                    The NCC believes that no child who truly wants to engage in singing and music education should be prevented from doing so
                    due to financial hardship. Our Financial Aid program is in place to help families with financial need
                    be a part of our program, while simultaneously advancing our mission of inclusivity and diversity.

                        During the application process for membership in the NCC, a family will express the desire for financial assistance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Upon successful completion of the audition and final interview, the family is sent a link to complete an online
                        <a href="https://nationalchildrenschorus.wufoo.com/forms/financial-aid-application-1718">application for financial aid</a>

                        Applicants must pay the NCC registration fee of $95 or $195 concurrently with filling out their financial aid materials.
                        This may be waived in rare cases for a family in very dire financial circumstances (annual income
                        below $10,000).

                        A deadline for all financial aid applications in a given season is set by the NCC Operations Manager.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the deadline has passed, the Operations Manager reviews all applications and imports data from the applications into
                        a dedicated spreadsheet for Financial Aid award tracking. The spreadsheet is stored in the NCC Dropbox
                        under NCC Executives/Financial Aid.

                    <li>
                        The Operations Manager schedules a phone meeting with the Executive Director or CEO to present the Financial Aid application
                        data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each application is given individual review. Financial need is determined through an assessment of the family&rsquo;s annual
                        income as reported on their most recently filed tax return, as well as a statement of any extraordinary
                        circumstances which may affect current expenses, such as a catastrophic employment loss, illness
                        or other hardship.

                    <li>
                        Proof of current annual income must be on file for each applicant. If the most recent tax return is not reflective of current
                        income (due to job loss or other circumstances) then pay stubs or other supporting documentation
                        must be collected to support the annual income number.

                        Awards are disbursed according to the following basic rubric:

                        The above guidelines are general in nature, and individual consideration is given to each applicant for unique circumstances.
                        For example, if annual income was $75,000 but an illness in the family had caused $40,000 in medical
                        expenses during the past year, a family could be given an award for the $35,000 annual income bracket
                        if they can provide documentation supporting the medical expenses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Operations Manager and Executive Director/CEO jointly determine the award amount for each applicant and enter it into
                        the Dropbox spreadsheet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Operations Manager sends notification to Financial Aid recipients by customizing an
                        <a hqid="1992042" href="#">e-mail template</a> for each person.

                        The Member Services Department tracks sign-ups for financial aid tuition accounts and ensures all accounts have been completed

                        amount that will make them able to participate in the program, while also making them value the services
                        of the organization.

                            Does the NCC help financial aid recipients cover the cost of anything besides tuition, such as the NCC uniform, NCC T-shirt
                            or music scores?
                        </p>
                        <p class="ncc-topic-response">
                            As a general rule, financial aid is only given to offset the cost of tuition, and recipients must still pay the registration
                            fee of $95 or $195, as well as the cost of the uniform and seasonal music. In rare cases, we
                            will make an exception and waive the registration fee, music fees or NCC t-shirt cost for families
                            in dire cases whose annual income is below $10,000 per year. The cost of the formal uniform cannot
                            be waived since it is purchased from a third-party vendor. However, to help with this, the NCC
                            can sometimes facilitate a Uniform Exchange event where used uniform pieces are available to
                            families for $5 each.

                            Does the NCC offer financial aid for the International Tour?
                        </p>
                        <p class="ncc-topic-response">
                            Yes. Any student who has received financial aid for NCC tuition may receive the same aid for the cost of the international
                            tour. For example, if a student is receiving a 30% tuition subsidization, they may also be subsidized
                            for 30% of the cost of a tour package. This only applies to the tour package for the student;
                            if a parent accompanies the student, s/he must pay full price for the tour.
