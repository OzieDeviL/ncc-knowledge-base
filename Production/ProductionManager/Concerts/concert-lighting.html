                <p>The concert is an experience of heightened senses. When a person commits to being an audience member, he
                    or she is committing, whether consciously or unconsciously, to exist for a limited time in a state of
                    enhanced focus and sensory processing. It is the job of the concert producer to understand this and to
                    create an experience that effectively considers and cares for the senses of the audience member at every
                    moment during the event. The concert producer is the ultimate event planner, and must make sure that
                    everything the guest processes is thoughtfully planned to a point which allows complete surrender. This
                    means people will experience soaring through beauty without ever being brought crashing down by a glitch,
                    error or unpleasant feeling caused by lack of consideration for their experience.</p>
                <p>The concert is measured against itself. It is a separate world from the real world. The producer must strive
                    to create contrast within the event so that all choices matter and have an impact. Nothing should get
                    old or lose its freshness.</p>

                        <p>Lighting should be used to enhance the impact of the music. We use the visual sense to sharpen the
                            auditory sense. Lighting should never draw attention to itself. The goal is for every audience
                            member to walk away thinking, “Wow, the music sounded beautiful.” We never want audience members
                            to actually comment on the lighting. The visuals must always serve the music and occupy a place
                            of secondary importance in the consciousness of the audience.</p>

                            <p>Extremely bright white “concert lighting” is rarely beautiful or effective. Orchestras, especially,
                                benefit from light with some amber tones that is not at 100% strength, balanced carefully
                                with the ability of the musicians to read their scores. This “fireside lighting” allows the
                                patina of the instruments to glow, and the audience can actually see the orchestra better.
                                If the orchestra is lit this way, so that the yellow/gold tones of the instruments are highlighted,
                                then blue is a great choice for a background, since blue is amber’s complimentary color on
                                the color wheel.

                            <p>There are some colors that register very strongly in the human consciousness and must be used
                                sparingly. Pure Red is an example of this. Pure Red should be used with great discretion,
                                and only briefly for very dramatic effects. It generally reads “anger” or “hell” or “lust.”
                                Don’t overuse Pure Red. One appearance per concert is generally the maximum.

                            <p>For some songs which are more pop or modern, it can be effective to create a concept which includes
                                a distinct shape or image. As with using Pure Red, one should only apply this one time in
                                the concert. Otherwise, it loses its effect. The example on the left was created for “Love
                                Train,” and the look only appeared on that single song in the performance. Audience members’
                                memory lasts the entire performance. They will remember specific looks and immediately be
                                bored by seeing them repeated.</p>
