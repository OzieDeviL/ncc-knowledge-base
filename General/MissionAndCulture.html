                    The National Children&rsquo;s Chorus, under the leadership of Artistic Director Luke McEndarfer and Associate Artistic Director
                    Dr. Pamela Blackstone, is quickly establishing itself as America&rsquo;s leading treble chorus, with
                    a set of ensembles based in Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington, D.C. Performing locally and abroad,
                    the National Children&rsquo;s Chorus is one of the few youth arts organizations in the world to have
                    its concert series presented by professional music halls. Its groundbreaking Season 2017/18, entitled
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work-title">Building Bridges</span>, expands on the chorus&rsquo; recent success, featuring an array of stunning repertoire,
                    demonstrating the organization&rsquo;s firm commitment to new music, world culture and extraordinary
                    professional collaborations. Venues since 2015 include Royce Hall, Walt Disney Concert Hall, Cathedral
                    of Our Lady of the Angels, and the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, as well as Carnegie Hall and Lincoln

                    American Youth Symphony and New York City Master Chorale, among others. At its conclusion, <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work-title">Building Bridges</span>
                    culminates in the NCC&rsquo;s; 4<sup>th</sup> major international tour to Germany, Austria, Czech Republic and Hungary. Tracing its lineage
                    back to the 1904 inception of the Paulist Choristers in Chicago, the National Children&rsquo;s Chorus
                    has garnered a superb reputation for musical excellence, and amassed an impressive r&eacute;sum&eacute;
                    of experience.

                    Master Chorale under the Sony Classical label. In addition, the National Children&rsquo;s Chorus has been featured
                    on numerous movie and television soundtracks, including on screen for Paramount Pictures and its 2009
                    film <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work-title">Imagine That</span>, starring Eddie Murphy. Through the years, the group performed numerous times as the
                    musical act on Jay Leno&rsquo;s former <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work-title">Tonight Show</span>, and its members are regularly contracted as solo artists
                    for professional engagements both in the studio and on stage, including principal roles on Broadway and
                    in opera.

                <p>
                    Students of the National Children&rsquo;s Chorus are represented by more than one hundred schools throughout its cities, and meet
                    weekly for rehearsal and musicianship study. The extensive curriculum includes college-level conducting,
                    composition, music theory, sight-singing in the Kod√°ly Method, and individual voice training in the
                    <span class="ncc-major-artistic-work-title">bel canto</span> style under the guidance of Michael Dean, Voice Department Chair at the UCLA School of Music. Through
                    a holistic approach to educating the full musician within each child, recent graduates from the program
                    have gone on to be accepted at top schools around the country, such as USC&rsquo;s Thornton School of Music,
                    UCLA&rsquo;s Herb Alpert School of Music, UC Berkeley, the Curtis Institute of Music, Northwestern University,
                    Indiana University, Manhattan School of Music, and The Juilliard School. Each summer, Senior Division
                    ensembles of the National Children&rsquo;s Chorus travel internationally, expanding the students&rsquo; cultural
                    awareness and worldly experience. Since 2015, the children have performed at the Sheldonian Theatre in
                    Oxford and St. John&rsquo;s Smith Square in London, England; the Great Wall of China in Beijing and the Ancient
                    City Wall in Xian, China; St. Mark&rsquo;s Basilica in Venice, St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica at the Vatican, and St.
                    Cecilia&rsquo;s Music Conservatory in Rome, Italy.
