                    Dear Tricia and Ryan,</p>
                <p>Congratulations! After careful review of your Financial Aid Application, the NCC Finance Committee has&nbsp;awarded
                    Sophie a scholarship for the 2017/18 Season in the amount of $1080 towards her annual tuition. Not all
                    students who apply for aid receive awards, but based on your financial information she was one of the
                    few chosen to receive a portion of the scholarship fund. Here is how the scholarship award will affect
                    the tuition amount:</p>
